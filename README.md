# Plotly-Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to find some specific bacteria that could be used in the process of synthetized beef. Plotly and Javascript were used to create a bar, bubble, and gauge chart along with the demographic bellybutton data.

## Results

These three charts demonstrate the following: bar chart- display the ten bacterias found in each subject; bubble chart- show all the bacterias found in the same specific subject and lastly the gauge chart shows the belly button washing frequency for each one. Each chart shows information in regards to bacteria cultures per sample. 

## Website Customization

To organize the website and make it more presentable, I created the template with bootstrap and to design it I used index.html and style.css. I changed the background color of the site to green to catch the eye of the reader and made the letters in bold with an orange color. I also used a picture of microbes in green color to match with the site background.
