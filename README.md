# Plotly-Project
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to use Plotly and Javascript to create a bar, bubble, and gauge chart to accompany the 
demographic bellybutton data on the dashboard.

These charts provide greater insight into the biodiversity of each patient. They contain information such as bacteria cultures per sample, 
which provide scientific names of the samples. They also contain information on the top bacteria cultures found and the bellybutton washing frequency of each patient.
